      <h3>The Project</h3>
      <p><br>
        The Visio De-sign project is a work developed by four people to the
        subject “Computer Vision”, from the Automatics and Robotics Master’s
        degree in Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. </p>
      <p>And, what’s it about? Well, … the field and goal could have been almost
        anything, but in our case, we have decided to focus on street signs
        recognition, mainly due to two factors: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The first one is just about current technology and developments in
            the personal vehicle industry: we need cars, among others, to be
            smarter each day, being capable of extract information from the
            environment and understand it like a human does.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The second one is personal: since we are tired of answering sign
            related captcha, it would be interesting that the entity who press
            the “I am not a robot” button is actually a robot. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
        <br />
        <h4>
            The methodology
        </h4>
      <p>
          We will divide the detection and classification phases, so different 
          techniques can be applied to each part. For the detection, we will use
          traditional computer vision techniques as HOG combined with clustering
          for image segmentation. The estimation of the regions of interest will 
          be made from that information.
      </p>
      <p>
          Once a ROI is generated, it will be transferred to a convolutional
          Neural Network for the classification part. For the CNN a pretrained
          network will be used in order to decrease the learning time.
      </p>
      <p>
          It is also interesting to split detection and classification because
          there is a larger number of images of traffic signs for the classification
          problem than images for the detection part. This will allow to train our
          model on a wider variety of images.
      </p>
      <p>
          The choice is made for purely didactic reasons, since the Visio De-Sign
          team considers it to be one of the best ways to apply the knowledge
          acquired in the Computer Vision course of the Master in Automation and
          Robotics at the UPM.

      <h3>The Team</h3>
      <p>In this page, the people involved in the development of the algorithm
        introduce themselves. We also give you some information about us to get
        a little bit closer to the project. These are our lives and stories.
        Nice to meet you!</p>

      <h5>Occupation: Technology leader</h5>
      <p style="line-height:25px">I am an Industrial Electronics and Automatics
        engineer. Although I was quickly interested in the electronics stuff, I
        really started enjoying this area of engineering when I started doing
        little projects with Arduino. Now I focus more on the maths and algorithms
        that brings "life" to a robot and I am currently working on the automatic
        control of a drone. Something I would like for humanity is that we become
        an interplanetary species, but not because we ran out of resources in our
        current one.</p>

      <p style="line-height:25px">“I am a student from the University of Alcalá,
        with a bachelor’s degreein Electronic Engineering and Industrial
        Automatics. I have also a programming title of Android apps, given by
        the EOI. I would like to start working in a job related to automatics,
        and specifically in interface development to improve communication
        between humans and robots in an industrial environment, also developing
        my skills as an application designer and applying system control
        knowledge. When I’m not meshing with job related stuff, I love going
        cycling and hiking to the mountain. Another of my main hobbies is
        traveling to other countries, because I can know about other cultures,
        and that’s a point that combines too well with my major passion: beer. I
        absolutely love finding new tastes and share these experiences with my
        friends.”</p>

        have studied programming by my own for a few years, and now I want to
        get a title to prove these skills, and some others I expect to get in
        the course. Talking about job, I ‘just’ hope I find motivation, being
        that achieved through a combination of good salaries, work conditions
        and interesting projects, because this will make me feel both important
        to the company and encouraged to improve every single day. To achieve
        that, I’m willing to seek abroad, as soon as I finish my current degree.
        My free time is always spent with the people I care, with simple but
        lovely afternoons. On the other hand, sometimes I enjoy playing online
        videogames to chill out. I also love traveling, but I haven´t had yet
        enough resources to visit a lot of places I would like to, so I will
        have a long to do list in the future.”</p>

      <h3>The Achievement</h3>
      <h4>Update: 08/10/2019</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>In order to obtain the regions of interest, the image has been set
            to a resolution of 20x26. This decision has been made because it is
            the minimum amount of information needed to be able to extract the
            relevant regions (where a signal can be) and remove uniform colour
            areas.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The presence of white signals on the road creates a distraction. A
            new image operation is proposed to avoid this effect. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using this new method, a simple algorithm has been developed. It
            works just fine with some images but returns an incorrect output
            with some others.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Further development is needed, but it seems this is going to be
            simple enough to get solved. Even without a neural network yet, we
            are getting interesting results. </p>
